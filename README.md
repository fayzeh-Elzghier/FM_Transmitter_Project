📡 FM Transmitter Project

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a basic FM Transmitter circuit. The system generates a frequency-modulated signal that can transmit audio over a short range and be received by standard FM radios.

🎯 Project Objective

To understand the fundamentals of frequency modulation (FM), signal generation, and basic wireless communication through a practical electronics implementation.

🧠 Key Concepts

Frequency Modulation (FM)

Oscillators and carrier signals

Audio signal modulation

RF transmission basics

Analog electronics fundamentals

🛠️ System Overview

The FM transmitter consists of:

Audio input source (microphone or audio signal)

Oscillator circuit to generate the carrier frequency

Modulation stage to vary the carrier frequency with audio

Transmission stage (antenna)

Power supply

⚙️ Features

Short-range FM signal transmission

Simple and low-cost circuit design

Educational and laboratory-oriented implementation
